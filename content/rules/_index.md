title: "📜 Server Rules"
description: "Please follow these rules to keep the server fun and friendly."

We want **everyone** to have a great time on the server. These simple rules keep things running smoothly:

1. **Be respectful** — no griefing, stealing, or toxic behavior.  
2. **No hacks, cheats, or exploits.** This includes x-ray texture packs and client mods that give unfair advantages.  
3. **Keep builds server-friendly.** Don’t build massive lag machines or chunk loaders without talking to admins first.  
4. **No PvP without consent.**  
5. **Have fun and explore!**

> 🛠️ Staff reserves the right to warn, kick, or ban anyone breaking these rules. Let’s keep it chill 😎
