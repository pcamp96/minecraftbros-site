Our server uses the **Beyond the Horizon** modpack for Minecraft.  

### 📦 How to Install
1. Download and install [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/) or your favorite mod launcher.  
2. Search for [Beyond the Horizon](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/bth-beyond-the-horizon) and install the latest version.  
3. Make sure you're using **Forge** or the included modloader version.  
5. Install [Create Mixed Stone](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create-mixed-stone). This mod allows us to build a custom cobble generator by mixing water and lava together.
6. Install [Create Sifting](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create-sifting/). This mod allows us to sift gravel and other siftable materials to gain new materials, making farming certain blocks easier.
